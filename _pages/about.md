I am assistant professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en), an elite technical university in France. I am co-leading the [BRAIn team (Better Representations for Artificial Intelligence)](http://brain.bzh) together with [Vincent Gripon](http://vincent-gripon.com/?l=en&p1=1&), [Giulia Lioi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mx2AqLYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mathieu Leonardon](https://www.mathieuleonardon.com/). 

My research interests include developing innovative methods to better understand Sounds and the Brain using modern machine learning and deep learning. On the methods side, BRAIN develops methods based on Graphs, such as [Graph Signal Processing](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2019-01-01-Spectral-Graph-Wavelet-Transform-as-Feature-Extractor-for-Machine-Learning-in-Neuroimaging) and [Graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09802.pdf). We are also contributing to [few-shot learning](https://paperswithcode.com/task/few-shot-image-classification), as well as on compressing deep learning architectures (see for examples [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9159769)).

Regarding applications in Neuroscience, I am particularly interested in auditory / music perception, time perception and sensorimotor timing (see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0773-6)) and the effect of music on the brain in healthy subjects and patients (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42005)), as well as involuntary musical imagery (a.k.a. earworms, see [here](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2015-01-01-Tunes-stuck-in-your-brain-The-frequency-and-affective-evaluation-of-involuntary-musical-imagery-correlate-with-cortical-structure) and [here](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2015-01-01-The-speed-of-our-mental-soundtracks-Tracking-the-tempo-of-involuntary-musical-imagery-in-everyday-life)). More recently, BRAIN has started to investigate the estimation of [encoding models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxENQtL8H) of brain activity using deep transfer learning, as well as investigating efficient deep learning architectures for audio applications.

I am also a [musician](https://nicofarr.github.io/music/) (I play jazz vibraphone and electronic instruments), and engage into transdisciplinary efforts in [Art and Science projects](https://nicofarr.github.io/artscience/).
