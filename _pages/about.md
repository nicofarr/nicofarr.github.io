I am assistant professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en), an elite technical university in France. I am co-leading the [BRAIn project (Better Representations for Artificial Intelligence)](https://brain.bzh) together with [Vincent Gripon](http://vincent-gripon.com/?l=en&p1=1&) and [Claude Berrou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Berrou). 

My research interests include developing innovative methods to better understand the brain using modern machine learning and deep learning. On the methods side, BRAIN develops methods based on Graphs, such as Graph Signal Processing and Graph neural networks. 
Regarding applications in Neuroscience, I am particularly interested in auditory / music perception, and the effect of music on the brain, as well as involuntary musical imagery (a.k.a. earworms). 

I am also a [musician](https://nicofarr.github.io/music/), and engage into transdisciplinary efforts in [Art and Science projects](https://nicofarr.github.io/artsci/).
