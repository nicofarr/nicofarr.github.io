I am assistant professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en), an elite technical university in France. I am co-leading the [BRAIn project (Better Representations for Artificial Intelligence)](https://brain.bzh) together with [Vincent Gripon](http://vincent-gripon.com/?l=en&p1=1&) and [Claude Berrou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Berrou). 

My research interests include developing innovative methods to better understand the brain using modern machine learning and deep learning. On the methods side, BRAIN develops methods based on Graphs, such as [Graph Signal Processing](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2019-01-01-Spectral-Graph-Wavelet-Transform-as-Feature-Extractor-for-Machine-Learning-in-Neuroimaging) and [Graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09802.pdf). 
Regarding applications in Neuroscience, I am particularly interested in auditory / music perception, time perception and sensorimotor timing (see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0773-6)) and the effect of music on the brain in healthy subjects and patients (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42005)), as well as involuntary musical imagery (a.k.a. earworms, see [here](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2015-01-01-Tunes-stuck-in-your-brain-The-frequency-and-affective-evaluation-of-involuntary-musical-imagery-correlate-with-cortical-structure) and [here](https://nicofarr.github.io/publication/2015-01-01-The-speed-of-our-mental-soundtracks-Tracking-the-tempo-of-involuntary-musical-imagery-in-everyday-life)). More recently, BRAIN has started to investigate the estimation of [encoding models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxENQtL8H) of brain activity using deep transfer learning.

I am also a [musician](https://nicofarr.github.io/music/) (I play jazz vibraphone and electronic instruments), and engage into transdisciplinary efforts in [Art and Science projects](https://nicofarr.github.io/artscience/).
