**About me**

I am full professor ([HdR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEmb2P4za0&ab_channel=Br.A.In.)) at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en), an elite technical university in France. I am in the [BRAIn team (Better Representations for Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/research-innovation/teams/brain) together with [Vincent Gripon](http://vincent-gripon.com/?l=en&p1=1&), [Giulia Lioi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mx2AqLYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Bastien Pasdeloup](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=dKOgoG4AAAAJ&hl=fr), [Axel Marmoret](https://ax-le.github.io/) and [Mathieu Leonardon](https://www.mathieuleonardon.com/). 

My research interests include developing innovative methods to better understand Sounds and the Brain using modern machine learning and deep learning. 

A few representative projects:
- Graph Signal Processing for Neuroimaging - see our [overview paper](https://direct.mit.edu/netn/article/5/2/322/97544/Gradients-of-connectivity-as-graph-Fourier-bases)
- [Deep Learning for EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07159)
- [Deep learning for Auditory Brain Encoding models](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.556533v2)
- [Silent Cities - acoustic measurements from soundscapes collected worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://osf.io/h285u/)
- Deep Learning for bioacoustics - see [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15824](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15824), [ICASSP'24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10248130) and [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09598)
- Collaborative projects in AI and ecoacoustics, in the context of the [Nocturnal Environment Observatory](https://observatoire-environnement-nocturne.cnrs.fr/en/presentation/)

I am also a [musician](https://nicofarr.github.io/music/) (I play jazz vibraphone and electronic instruments), and engage into transdisciplinary efforts in [Art and Science projects](https://nicofarr.github.io/artscience/).

The best updated list of publications is the one on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=IO4nLK4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works)
