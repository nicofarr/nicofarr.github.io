The purpose of this post is to share [a story written by a colleague](https://lifeology.io/silent-cities-monitoring-the-sound-of-human-quarantine-around-the-globe/) about [Silent Cities](https://osf.io/h285u/), an open-science project aiming at documenting urban city soundscapes during and after Covid'19 lockdown.
