My PhD student Ilyass Moummad has received the Jury Award, for his work on Few-shot Bioacoustic event detection at the [2023 DCASE Challenge](https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection-results). In collaboration with [Romain Serizel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_PXk20cAAAAJ&hl=en), we proposed a simple solution consisting in pretraining using supervised contrastive learning, prior to few shot generalization. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00878). 

Congratulations Ilyass!
