We are very proud to announce [our new paper](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00448/127376/Structure-function-coupling-and-decoupling-during), from PhD student Venkatesh Subramani, published today in Imaging Neuroscience ! This work is a collaboration between the [BRAIn team](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/research-innovation/teams/brain) with Giulia Lioi and myself, as well as [Karim Jerbi](http://www.karimjerbi.com/). 

Venkatesh presents new results on structure-function coupling in the brain using EEG and Structural connectivity on healthy human subjects, with methods from Graph Signal Processing, and compares video watching with resting state. 

Congratulations Venkatesh!
